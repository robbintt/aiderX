# Future Directions for the Controller Model

This document outlines potential future directions for `aider`'s "controller model" feature. The goal is to evolve it from a passive analysis tool into an active, intelligent orchestrator that makes `aider` more powerful and adaptive.

## Current Implementation

Currently, the `--controller-model` serves as a preliminary analysis step.

- **Functionality:** When enabled, a specified controller model is invoked before the main coding model. It is tasked with analyzing the user's request and the provided code context.
- **Prompting:** The controller is explicitly instructed *not* to fulfill the user's request. Instead, its system prompt directs it to "rate the precision of the request and assess the relevance of the context."
- **Output:** The analysis generated by the controller model is printed to the user's console for informational purposes.
- **Limitation:** The controller's output is purely advisory and does not programmatically influence the behavior of the main model. It acts as a "second opinion" rather than a true controller that directs the subsequent workflow.

This initial implementation provides a solid foundation. The following ideas propose ways to build upon it, transforming the controller into a core component of `aider`'s intelligence.

## Proposed Enhancements

Here are four key areas where the controller model could be enhanced to actively manage the coding process.

### Idea 1: Dynamic Strategy Selection

The controller could function as a high-level router, dynamically selecting the most effective strategy for each user request.

-   **Concept:** Analyze the user's prompt to determine its complexity, scope, and intent. Based on this analysis, the controller would choose the optimal `Coder` and `edit_format` for the main model to use.
-   **Example Workflow:**
    -   **User Request:** "Fix the typo in the `get_user_data` function name."
    -   **Controller Analysis:** Simple, localized change.
    -   **Action:** Selects the `diff` edit format for a precise, minimal change.
    -   ---
    -   **User Request:** "Refactor the authentication logic into a separate service class."
    -   **Controller Analysis:** Complex, architectural change affecting multiple files.
    -   **Action:** Switches to the `architect` coder to first generate a plan of action.
-   **Benefit:** This would make `aider` more adaptive and efficient, automatically applying the best tool for the job without requiring the user to manually switch modes.

### Idea 2: Interactive Request Refinement

The controller could act as a "prompt engineer," collaborating with the user to improve the clarity and completeness of their request *before* it is sent to the main model.

-   **Concept:** If the controller detects ambiguity, missing context, or potential edge cases in the user's prompt, it would be prompted to ask clarifying questions.
-   **Example Workflow:**
    -   **User Request:** "Optimize this function."
    -   **Controller Analysis:** Ambiguous goal. "Optimize" can mean many things.
    -   **Action:** The controller asks the user, "How should I optimize it? Should I prioritize reducing execution time, lowering memory consumption, or improving readability?"
-   **Benefit:** This prevents the main (and often more expensive) model from making incorrect assumptions, leading to fewer wasted API calls, faster resolution, and more accurate results.

### Idea 3: Task Decomposition and Planning

For large or multi-step tasks, the controller could serve as a project manager, breaking down the problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable sub-tasks.

-   **Concept:** The controller analyzes a high-level goal and generates a step-by-step implementation plan. It then guides the main model through the execution of this plan, one step at a time, validating the result of each step before proceeding to the next.
-   **Example Workflow:**
    -   **User Request:** "Add OAuth2 login with Google to my web app."
    -   **Controller Analysis:** This is a complex feature requiring multiple, sequential changes.
    -   **Action:** The controller generates a plan and presents it to the user:
        1.  Add `google-auth-library` to `requirements.txt`.
        2.  Create a database migration to add a `google_id` column to the `users` table.
        3.  Implement the `/auth/google/callback` endpoint to handle the OAuth flow.
        4.  Update the login page to include a "Sign in with Google" button.
    -   The controller then executes each step with the main model.
-   **Benefit:** This approach dramatically improves the reliability and success rate for implementing complex features that are too large to be handled in a single pass.

### Idea 4: Response Validation and Self-Correction

The controller could create a powerful "self-healing" loop by reviewing and validating the output generated by the main model.

-   **Concept:** After the main model proposes a code change, the controller is invoked a second time. It is prompted to critically evaluate the solution: Does it fully address the original request? Does it introduce any obvious bugs or logical flaws? Does it violate project conventions? If it finds a problem, it provides feedback to the main model for a revision.
-   **Example Workflow:**
    -   **User Request:** "Refactor this to handle cases where `user` is null."
    -   **Main Model:** Generates code but forgets to check for `user.profile` also being null.
    -   **Controller Analysis:** The main model's code will throw a `NullPointerException` if `user.profile` is null.
    -   **Action:** The controller re-invokes the main model with the original request plus new instructions: "Your previous attempt was incorrect. It failed to check if `user.profile` is null before accessing its properties. Please correct this."
-   **Benefit:** This creates a quality gate that catches errors automatically, significantly reducing the burden of manual code review and correction for the user. It allows `aider` to iteratively refine its own work.
